# Malware Prediction
The aim of the project is to implement a binary classifier that can predict whether or not a Windows machine has been infected by malware, based on the properties of that machine. Models, used in this project, are implemented from scratch.
## Techniques
* Preprocess (Çağatay Küpeli)
* Random Forest (Çağatay Küpeli)
* Neural Network (Çağatay Küpeli)
* K-means (Alper Mehmet Özdemir)
## Dataset
This project is based on a completed Kaggle Competition called “Microsoft Malware Prediction”. There is a dataset in the competition’s website. According to the information given on the website, this dataset is provided by Microsoft to encourage finding more effective methods to predict malware occurrence.
